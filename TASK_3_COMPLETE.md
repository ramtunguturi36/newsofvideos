- ❌ **Error Details**: Shows which items failed with specific error messages
- ✅ **Success Feedback**: Toast notifications for successful operations

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
Each manager component includes:
```typescript
const [selectedFolderIds, setSelectedFolderIds] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
const [selectedContentIds, setSelectedContentIds] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
const [bulkDeleteOpen, setBulkDeleteOpen] = useState(false);
const [isBulkDeleting, setIsBulkDeleting] = useState(false);
const totalSelected = selectedFolderIds.size + selectedContentIds.size;
```

### Handler Functions
- `toggleFolderSelection(id)` - Toggle individual folder
- `toggleContentSelection(id)` - Toggle individual content item
- `toggleSelectAllFolders()` - Select/deselect all folders
- `toggleSelectAllContent()` - Select/deselect all content
- `openBulkDelete()` - Open confirmation modal
- `handleBulkDelete()` - Execute bulk deletion with error handling

### Auto-Clear Behavior
Selections automatically clear when navigating to different folders to prevent accidental deletions across different locations.

---

## 📊 Deletion Logic

### Sequential Processing
Items are deleted **sequentially** (not in parallel) to:
1. Avoid overwhelming the server with concurrent requests
2. Track individual item success/failure accurately
3. Provide clear progress feedback to users

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Partial Success**: Some items delete successfully while others fail
- **Error Collection**: Errors stored with item names for detailed reporting
- **User Feedback**: Shows success count + detailed list of failures
- **Modal Behavior**: 
  - Stays open on errors (allows user to see what failed)
  - Closes automatically on full success
- **Selection State**: Cleared only on complete success

### Cascade Deletion
- **Backend Handles**: Cascade deletion implemented on backend
- **Frontend Warns**: Clear visual warnings shown to users
- **Recursive**: Deletes all subfolders and contents automatically

---

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### For Administrators
1. **Time Savings**: Delete multiple items in seconds vs. minutes
2. **Bulk Cleanup**: Remove test data, old content, or entire folder trees quickly
3. **Confidence**: See exactly what will be deleted before confirming
4. **Transparency**: Clear feedback on what succeeded and what failed
5. **Safety**: Cannot accidentally proceed without explicit confirmation

### For Users (Indirect)
1. **Cleaner Content**: Admins can keep marketplace organized
2. **Better Performance**: Removing unused content improves system performance
3. **Quality Control**: Easier to remove outdated or incorrect content

---

## 📝 Code Quality

### Consistency
- **Identical Pattern**: All four managers follow the exact same implementation pattern
- **Reusable Logic**: Functions are similar across components for maintainability
- **Consistent UI**: Same look and feel across all content types

### Best Practices
- ✅ TypeScript type safety with `Set<string>` for O(1) lookups
- ✅ Proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Loading states to prevent double-clicks
- ✅ Accessible UI with proper ARIA labels on checkboxes
- ✅ Stop propagation on checkboxes to prevent card clicks

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Basic Operations
- [x] Select single folder → delete
- [x] Select single content item → delete
- [x] Select multiple folders → delete
- [x] Select multiple content items → delete
- [x] Select mixed (folders + content) → delete

### Select All Functionality
- [x] Click "Select All" for folders
- [x] Click "Select All" for content
- [x] Click "Deselect All" to clear selections

### Navigation Behavior
- [x] Select items → navigate to different folder → verify selections cleared

### Error Scenarios
- [x] Network failure during deletion
- [x] Permission errors
- [x] Partial failures (some succeed, some fail)

### Edge Cases
- [x] Empty folder deletion
- [x] Folder with nested folders and content
- [x] Very large selections (50+ items)
- [x] Attempt to delete while already deleting (disabled state)

## 🔄 Integration with Previous Tasks

### Task 1: Cascade Deletion
- Multi-select delete **leverages** backend cascade deletion
- Warnings properly inform users about cascade behavior
- Works seamlessly with folder hierarchy

### Task 2: Bulk Upload
- Complements bulk upload functionality
- Users can now bulk upload AND bulk delete
- Complete workflow for content management

---

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
1. **Set Data Structure**: O(1) lookup for selected item checks
2. **Sequential Deletion**: Prevents server overload
3. **Minimal Re-renders**: State updates batched appropriately
4. **Lazy Loading**: Modal content only renders when open

### Scalability
- Tested with selections up to 100+ items
- Memory efficient with Set-based storage
- No performance degradation with large datasets

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. Consistent pattern across all components
2. Clear visual feedback at every step
3. Comprehensive error handling
4. User-centric confirmation modal design

### Future Enhancements
1. **Progress Bar**: Real-time progress for large deletions
2. **Undo Feature**: Temporary undo buffer (5-second window)
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl+A for select all, Delete key trigger
4. **Batch API**: Single endpoint for multiple deletes (server-side optimization)
5. **Selection Persistence**: Remember selections during page refresh (optional)
6. **Export Selection**: Export list of selected items before deletion
